## What is Passive Voice?

The passive voice is used when we want to emphasize the action or the object of the action rather than who performs it. In passive constructions, the subject receives the action instead of performing it.

- **Passive 1**: I **was given** a present (by them).
- **Passive 2**: A present **was given** to me (by them).

### Examples with "tell":
- **Active**: She told **us** the story.
- **Passive 1**: We **were told** the story (by her).
- **Passive 2**: The story **was told** to us (by her).

### Other verbs with two objects:
- send, show, teach, offer, ask, bring, buy, lend, pass, pay, promise, sell, write

### Passive Voice with Reporting Verbs

### Passive Voice with Phrasal Verbs

The phrasal verb stays together in passive voice.

### Passive Infinitives and Gerunds

### Passive Infinitive: to be + past participle

- The letter needs **to be sent** today.

### Passive Gerund: being + past participle
- I don't like **being told** what to do.

### Get Passive

"Get" can be used instead of "be" in informal passive constructions, especially for unexpected or unpleasant events.

- She **got promoted**. (= was promoted)

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### 1. Don't use passive with intransitive verbs

- ‚úÖ The accident happened yesterday.

### 2. Don't forget "by" when mentioning the agent

- ‚úÖ The book was written **by** Shakespeare.

### 3. Don't use passive when active is more natural
- ‚ùå The homework was done by me.
- ‚úÖ I did the homework.

### 4. Make sure the tense of "be" matches the intended time
- ‚ùå The house is built in 1990.
- ‚úÖ The house **was** built in 1990.
