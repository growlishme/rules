## Types of Phrasal Verbs

### Separable Phrasal Verbs
The object can go between the verb and particle or after the particle.

**Examples**:
- Turn **off** the TV. = Turn the TV **off**.
- Pick **up** the book. = Pick the book **up**.

**Note**: If the object is a pronoun, it MUST go between the verb and particle.
- Turn **it** off. (NOT: Turn off it.)
- Pick **them** up. (NOT: Pick up them.)

### Inseparable Phrasal Verbs
The object must come after the particle.

**Examples**:
- Look **after** the children. (NOT: Look the children after.)
- Get **over** the illness. (NOT: Get the illness over.)
