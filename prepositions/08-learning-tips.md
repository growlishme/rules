1. **Learn in context**: Always learn prepositions with example sentences
2. **Study common combinations**: Memorize verb + preposition and adjective + preposition combinations
3. **Pay attention to differences**: Compare prepositions in your native language vs. English
4. **Practice regularly**: Use flashcards or apps to practice
5. **Read extensively**: Notice how prepositions are used in authentic texts
6. **Don't translate directly**: Prepositions don't always match between languages
7. **Focus on the most common**: Master frequent prepositions first (at, in, on, to, from, for, with, by, about, of)
8. **Use visual aids**: Draw diagrams to understand spatial prepositions
9. **Keep a notebook**: Write down new prepositional phrases as you encounter them
10. **Test yourself**: Try to use prepositions actively in your speaking and writing
